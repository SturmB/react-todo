# React To-Do

This project is a simple, tiny, to-do list that runs in a browser window. It is not currently customizable and is only meant to be a test of my React skills.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node installed first. Then clone this repo, cd into its directory, and run:

```lang.shell
$ npm install -g serve
$ serve -s build
```

This will start up a local web server whereby you can now access the app by pointing your browser to `http://localhost:5000`. You can stop the server at anytime by hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.

Be aware that this is merely a test of React's state functionality and, thus, any data entered into it will not survive a browser refresh. Nothing is stored permanently.
